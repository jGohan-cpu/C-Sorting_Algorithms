[Bubble Sort](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/C-Sorting_Algorithms/blob/master/0-bubble_sort.c): A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire array is sorted.

[Insertion Sort](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/C-Sorting_Algorithms/blob/master/2-selection_sort.c): Another simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates over the array, inserting each element in its proper position.

[Selection Sort](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/C-Sorting_Algorithms/blob/master/2-selection_sort.c): A straightforward comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the leftmost element in the unsorted part.

[Quick Sort](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/C-Sorting_Algorithms/blob/master/3-quick_sort.c): A highly efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, one with elements smaller than the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot. The process is repeated recursively on the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

All the O files have there time complexity in order from best (being the best) from worst (being the bottom)
